# Buying Power
How does an option affect buying power

## Margin Requirements

In traditional finance, some types of account such IRA or Level 1 trading account require all options to be fully collateralized.
Specifically, users in IRA accounts can only sell cash-secured puts or covered calls, which means they have to deposit the notional value of the underlying position in cash (for cash-secured puts) or own the underlying shares (for covered calls).

Undercollateralization is handled by reducing the buying power requirement of an asset.
A Level 4 trading account in a TradFi brokerage firm allows users to sell naked puts and naked calls by only posting 5x less collateral than users in a Level 1 account.
For Portfolio margin accounts, the collateral requirements could be even smaller, requiring about 10-15x less collateral than a Level 1 account.

Panoptic makes use of built-in leverage similar to level 4 trading to enable the minting of undercollateralized options.
The collateralization requirements follows the guidelines outlined by the CBOE and FINRA, and can be summarized as follows:

$$
\mathtt{MaximumOf\left[notionalValue \cdot 20\%,\ notionalValue\cdot\left(1-80\%\frac{Price}{strike} \right)\right]}
$$ 

It helps to visualize the collateral requirement *for a short put at strike K* compared to the in-the-money amount and the liquidation bonus (more details in the [liquidation](docs/panoptic-protocol/liquidations) page) in a graph:

## Buying Power Reduction


The amount of capital available to place trade with is defined by this collateral and is called the *Buying Power*.
The minting of any option in Panoptic will reduce the account's Buying Power.
The Buying Power Reduction of an option depends on 1) the notional value of that option and 2) the price of the underlying asset and 3) the risks associated with trading the underlying assets.

Determining the buying power reduction from points 1) and 2) can be compute in a faitly straightforward manner (see sections below).
The impact of point 3), on the other hand, is not as clearly defined.
In TradFi, for instance, selling calls on GameStop (GME) may require a 100% collateral requirement whereas as liquidty underlying like Apple (AAPL) may only have a 20% collateral requirement.
The choice to change the collateral requirement of a specific asset resides entirely within the power of centralized actors at each brokerage firms.

In Panoptic, we evaluate the relative risk of a specific asset by looking at the pool utilization at the time the position was minted.
The rational behind this is as follows.
If an asset is in high demand, then there will be a lot of trading activity and most liquidity will be actively traded.
This means that liquidity that is normally available to trade/adjust/roll positions will be reduced for underlyings that either have 1) significant trading activity or 2) low liquidity.

### Cross-collateralization

In TradFi, most options on equities are collateralized using cash.  

Users can choose to deposit a single type of collateral: Alice could decide to deposit 4500 Dai as collateral, and Bob could decide to deposit 3ETH.
In this case, if the price is 1500 Dai, then both Alice and Bob would all have the same buying power, about 4500 Dai to sell puts and 3 ETH to sell calls.
The maximum loss for Alice when selling puts would be 4500 Dai (if the price of ETH goes to 0), but it could be potentially infinite if she chooses to sell naked calls instead (this will happend if the price goes to $\infty$).
Similarly, the maximum loss for Bob when selling calls is 3 ETH (if the price of ETH goes to $\infty$) and could potentially be infinity of he chooses to sell naked puts instead (which happens if the price of ETH goes to zero).

For this reason, we recommend that users deposit both collateral when trading both puts and calls.
For example, if Charlie deposits 1500 Dai and 2 ETH the ETH-Dai-30bps Panoptic Pool when the price of ETH is 1500Dai, then their buying power on the put side is 4500 Dai and it is 3 ETH on the call side.
In this case, the maximum loss will be bounded by the amount of collateral desposited and Charlie could never lose more than they deposited.

However, in all those scenarios, any change in price or accumulation of long premium could make Alice's, Bob's or Charlie's accounts insolvent and lead their account to be [liquidated](docs/panoptic-protocol/liquidations).

### Buying Power Requirement (buying out-the-money options)

The buying power requirement for buying an option is simply: 
```solidity
BUYING POWER REQUIREMENT (buying) =
    BUY_COLLATERAL_RATIO * NOTIONAL_VALUE +
    IN_THE_MONEY_AMOUNT
```

The collateralization ratio for buying an option depends on the pool utilization.
For out-the-money options, it is set at a fixed 10% for pool utilization less than 50% and decrease to 5% at 90% or more.
If an option is minted in-the-money (ITM), then the ITM amount is automatically deducted from the user's balance.


```solidity

BUY
_COLLATERAL
_RATIO        ^
              |   
              |
              |   max ratio = 10%                         
        10% - |-------------------------______              min ratio = 5%
        5%  - |                        .      ¯¯¯¯¯¯------___________
              |                        .                  .    .
              +------------------------+------------------+----+---->   POOL_UTILIZATION
                                      50%                 90%   100%

```


### Buying Power Requirement (selling out-the-money options)

The buying power requirement (BPR) for selling an option is :

```solidity
BUYING POWER REQUIREMENT (selling) =
   SELL_COLLATERAL_RATIO * NOTIONAL_VALUE -
   IN_THE_MONEY_AMOUNT
```

For an out-the-money option, the collateralization ratio for selling an option is set at a fixed 20% for pool utilization less than 50% and increases to 100% at pool utilization >90%.
When an option is minted in-the-money, the ITM amount is negative and the user may see their collateral balance increase.

```solidity

SELL
_COLLATERAL
_RATIO        ^                                            max ratio = 100%
       100% - |                                            _________

              |                                  __-¯¯     .    .
              |  min ratio = 20%            __-¯¯          .    .
        20% _ |_________________________--¯¯               .    .

              +------------------------+-------------------+----+--->   POOL_UTILIZATION
                                    50%                   90%   100%

```

## Maintenance Margin Requirement (in-the-money options)
For options that have been minted out-the-money (OTM), the buying power requirement is simply given by the sell and buy collateral ration calculated above.
As the price evolves and an option becomes in-the-money, risks may increase and the amout of collateral may need to increase to mitigate those risks.

For example, selling an OTM put option initially requires 20% collateralization.
As the price changes and decreases below the strike price, the buying power requirement will increase above 20%.
The exact buying power requirement for a put at strike $\mathtt{K}$ when the current price is $\mathtt{S}$ and an initial collateral ratio of $\mathtt{C_i}$ is given by: 
$$
\mathtt{Buying\ Power\ Requirement = notionalSize \cdot \left(100\% - (100\% - C_i)\cdot\frac{S}{K}\right)}
$$

In contrast, the in-the-money amount (or the amount of funds necessary to cover the option) is always lower than the buying power requirement, and it is defined as $\mathtt{ITM\ amount = notionalSize \cdot\left(100\% - \frac{S}{K} \right)}$.
So, selling a 1000 ETH-USDC put will start with a buying power requirement of 200 USDC when the price is above 1000 but will increase to 500 USDC if the price decreases to 625, whereas the ITM amount will be 400.


```solidity

The buying power requirement of a call can exceed the notional value of the minted option.
However, users can deposit the asset as collateral in order to mitigate those risks.
