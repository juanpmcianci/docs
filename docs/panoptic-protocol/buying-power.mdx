# Buying Power
How does an option affect buying power

## Buying Power Reduction


The amount of capital available to place a trade is called the *Buying Power*.
The minting of any option in Panoptic will reduce the account's Buying Power, and the Buying Power Reduction (BPR) of an option depends on 1) the notional value of that option and 2) the price of the underlying asset and 3) the risks associated with trading the underlying assets.

Determining the buying power reduction from points 1) and 2) can be computed in a fairly straightforward manner (see sections below).
The impact of point 3), on the other hand, is not as clearly defined.
In TradFi, for instance, selling calls on GameStop (GME) may require a 100% collateral requirement whereas as liquidty underlying like Apple (AAPL) may only have a 20% collateral requirement.
The choice to change the collateral requirement of a specific asset resides entirely within the power of centralized actors at each brokerage firms.

In Panoptic, we evaluate the relative risk of a specific asset by looking at the pool utilization at the time the position was minted.
The rational behind this is as follows.
If an asset is in high demand, then there will be a lot of trading activity and most liquidity will be actively traded.
This means that liquidity that is normally available to trade/adjust/roll positions will be reduced for underlyings that either have 1) significant trading activity or 2) low liquidity.

### Cross-collateralization

<!--In TradFi, most options on equities are collateralized using cash or investments with stable value.
This means that the maximum loss for a cash-secured put is limited -->

In Panoptic, every user must deposit collateral in the `PanopticPool` before they can mint long or short options.
Liquidity providers can simply deposit their collateral like they would do in a lending protocol, and collect yields every time a user mints an option.

#### Single-collateral
Let's consider Alice and Bob, who choose to deposite a single type of collateral: Alice deposits 4500 Dai as collateral, and Bob deposits 3ETH.
In this case, if the price is 1500 Dai, then both Alice and Bob would all have the same buying power, about 4500 Dai to sell puts and 3 ETH to sell calls.

The maximum loss for Alice when selling puts would be 4500 Dai, which would happen if the price of ETH goes to 0.
The maximum loss if she chooses to sell naked calls instead could potentially be infinite: the max loss is unbounded and continues to linearly increase as the price goes to $\infty$.

Similarly, the maximum loss for Bob when selling calls is 3 ETH (if the price of ETH goes to $\infty$) and could potentially be infinity of he chooses to sell naked puts instead (which happens if the price of ETH goes to zero).

#### Cross-collateral
Since losses could potentially be infinite, we recommend that users deposit both collateral when trading both puts and calls.
For example, let's consider what happens if Charlie deposits 1500 Dai and 2 ETH the ETH-Dai Panoptic Pool when the price of ETH is 1500Dai.
Their buying power on the put side is 4500 Dai and it is 3 ETH on the call side, which is the same as Alice's and Bob's from the example above.

The maximum loss for Charlie, however, will be constrained by the amount of collateral desposited.
Charlie's max loss for selling naked calls will be partially covered by their 2 ETH of collateral, and the max loss will increase more slowly than Alice's
Similarly, Charlie's max loss for selling puts will also partially covered by their 1500Dai of collateral.
In that case, Charlie's max loss will increase more slowly than Bobs's.

However, in all those scenarios, any change in price or accumulation of long premium could make Alice's, Bob's or Charlie's accounts insolvent and lead their account to be [liquidated](docs/panoptic-protocol/liquidations).

### Buying Power Requirement (buying out-the-money options)

The buying power requirement for buying an option is simply: 
```solidity
BUYING POWER REQUIREMENT (buying) =
    BUY_COLLATERAL_RATIO * NOTIONAL_VALUE +
    IN_THE_MONEY_AMOUNT
```

The collateralization ratio for buying an option depends on the pool utilization.
For out-the-money options, it is set at a fixed 10% for pool utilization less than 50% and decrease to 5% at 90% or more.
If an option is minted in-the-money (ITM), then the ITM amount is automatically deducted from the user's balance.


```solidity

BUY
_COLLATERAL
_RATIO        ^
              |   
              |
              |   max ratio = 10%                         
        10% - |-------------------------______              min ratio = 5%
        5%  - |                        .      ¯¯¯¯¯¯------___________
              |                        .                  .    .
              +------------------------+------------------+----+---->   POOL_UTILIZATION
                                      50%                 90%   100%

```


### Buying Power Requirement (selling out-the-money options)

The buying power requirement (BPR) for selling an option is :

```solidity
BUYING POWER REQUIREMENT (selling) =
   SELL_COLLATERAL_RATIO * NOTIONAL_VALUE -
   IN_THE_MONEY_AMOUNT
```

For an out-the-money option, the collateralization ratio for selling an option is set at a fixed 20% for pool utilization less than 50% and increases to 100% at pool utilization >90%.
When an option is minted in-the-money, the ITM amount is negative and the user may see their collateral balance increase.

```solidity

SELL
_COLLATERAL
_RATIO        ^                                            max ratio = 100%
       100% - |                                            _________
              |                                       __-¯¯.    .
              |                                  __-¯¯     .    .
              |  min ratio = 20%            __-¯¯          .    .
        20% _ |_________________________--¯¯               .    .
              |                        .                   .    .
              +------------------------+-------------------+----+--->   POOL_UTILIZATION
                                    50%                   90%   100%

```
