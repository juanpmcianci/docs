# Commissions
How does Panoptic calculate commissions

## Commission Fees

In traditional brokerage firms, a fixed commission is charged when a position is opened AND closed.
With options, no commission is paid regardless if the user allows the option to expire expires.
A perhaps perverse incentive of this model is that users may keep their position open for longer because they do not want to pay that commission fee.

In Panoptic, since options never expire, commissions are only paid when a new position is minted. 
We believe that this will eliminate the impact of the commissionf ee on the user's decision-making process when closing a position. 


### Commission rate and pool utilization

The value of the commission to be paid is the `notional value` of the option (ie. the amount of token moved to/from the Uniswap pool) multiplied by the commission rate:
Note that the commission will alway be paid in terms of the `tokenype` of the position: it will be paid using `token0` for puts and `token1` for calls.

```solidity
commission = (notional value) * commissionRate()
```

The commission fee start at 60bps below 10% pool utilization and linearly decreases to 20bps at >50% pool utilization.
The reason why the commission is high at low pool utilizations is to ensure that Liquidity Providers receive a reasonable yield even if there is low trading activity. 
Keeping the commission rate constant above the target utilization rate of 50% also means traders will be not be disincentitized to trade as the market activity increases.

```solidity
COMMISSION
_RATE         ^
              |  max commission = 60bps
     60bps  _ |_____

              +----+-------------------+------------------------+--->   POOL_UTILIZATION
                  10%                 50%                      100%

```
