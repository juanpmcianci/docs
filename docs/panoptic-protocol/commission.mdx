# Commissions
How does Panoptic calculate commissions

## Commission Fees

In traditional brokerage firms, a fixed commission is changed when a position is opened AND closed.
With options, no commission is paid regardless if the user allows the option to expire expires.
A perhaps perverse incentive of this model is that users may keep their position open for longer because they do not want to pay that commission fee.

In Panoptic, since options never expire, commissions are only paid when a new position is minted. 
We believe that this will eliminate the impact of the commissionf ee on the user's decision-making process when closing a position. 


### Commission rate and pool utilization

The value of the commission to be paid is the `notional value` of the option (ie. the amount of token moved to/from the Uniswap pool) multiplied by the commission rate:
Note that the commission will alway be paid in terms of the `tokenype` of the position: it will be paid using `token0` for puts and `token1` for calls.

```solidity
commission = (notional value) * commissionRate()
```

The commission fee decreases to 20bps at >50% pool utilization and linearly increases to reach 60bps for pool utilization below 10%.

```solidity
COMMISSION
_RATE         ^
              |  max commission = 60bps
     60bps  _ |_____

              +----+-------------------+------------------------+--->   POOL_UTILIZATION
                  10%                 50%                      100%

```
