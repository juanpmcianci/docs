# Margin
How is margin trading implemented in Panoptic

## Margin Requirements

In traditional finance, some types of account such IRA or Level 1 trading account require all options to be fully collateralized.
Specifically, users in IRA accounts can only sell cash-secured puts or covered calls, which means they have to deposit the notional value of the underlying position in cash (for cash-secured puts) or own the underlying shares (for covered calls).

Undercollateralization is handled by reducing the buying power requirement of an asset.
A Level 4 trading account in a TradFi brokerage firm allows users to sell naked puts and naked calls by only posting 5x less collateral than users in a Level 1 account.
For Portfolio margin accounts, the collateral requirements could be even smaller, requiring about 10-15x less collateral than a Level 1 account.

Panoptic makes use of built-in leverage similar to level 4 trading to enable the minting of undercollateralized options.
The collateralization requirements follows the guidelines outlined by the CBOE and FINRA, and can be summarized as follows:

$$
\mathtt{MaximumOf\left[notionalValue \cdot 20\%,\ notionalValue\cdot\left(1-80\%\frac{Price}{strike} \right)\right]}
$$ 

It helps to visualize the collateral requirement *for a short put at strike K* compared to the in-the-money amount and the liquidation bonus (more details in the [liquidation](docs/panoptic-protocol/liquidations) page) in a graph:
