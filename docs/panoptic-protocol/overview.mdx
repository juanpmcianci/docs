# Panoptic overview
This is an introductory summary of the Panoptic Protocol.

# Who should use Panoptic?

Options are one of the most traded instrument in traditional finance.
They can be used to [hedge](docs/trading/basic-concepts) a portfolio, [speculate](/docs/trading/perpetual-options) on the value of an asset, create [synthetic positions](docs/trading/multi-leg-strategies) in a capital-efficient manner, or as a way to create [defined-risk](docs/trading/risks) positions.

Investors that first learn about options may be overwhelmed at first. 
While the math behind options may seem daunting for most users, anyone without a math background may still earn sustainable returns as long as users follow a cores set of [basic rules](/docs/trading/basic-concepts).

Here is how Panoptic can be valuable investment instrument for different user profiles:

<details>
<summary>1. Retail Users</summary>
Retail investors may trade options the same way they trade stock or tokens: buy call options to profit when the underlying increases in price, or buy put options to profit when the underlying goes down in price.

Retail user can also choose to participate indecentralize option vaults (a novel type of managed investment instrument pioneered by Ribbon) that can easily be implemented in Panoptic to target strategy that can be bearish, bullish, delta-neutral, or any combination thereof.

<details>
<summary>2. "Pro-tail" Users</summary>
Investors which are comfortable enough to manage a self-directed investment portfolio (we call those professional retail, or pro-tail, users) may employ strategies that fill the "complexity" gap between the retail and professional levels.

In Panoptic, these users could be DeFi-native users that are comfortable with liquidity providing in AMMs and liquidity mining in protocol such as Uniswap or Sushiswap.
Or they could be seasoned TradFi options traders that may want to get exposure to 24/7 markets on the long-tail of digital assets that are tradable on Uniswap v3.

<details>
<summary>3. Market Makers and Uniswap v3 Liquidity Providers</summary>
Market making by sophisticated actors is necessary to create markets that are liquid enough to allow retail and pro-tail users to use varied strategies.
In Panoptic, market making involves responding to both the demand from buyers and the need to stability prices within a Uniswap v3 pool.

<details>
<summary>4. Institutions</summary>
Institution may need to hedge their portfolio exposure.
They may do this by purchasing put options on pairs representative of the crypto market (eg. ETH-USDC, ETH-BTC, etc).
Alternatively, funds may sell calls on token they hold as a way to realize profits on tokens.

In addition, institutions may deposit funds in the Panoptic pool as liquidity providers in order to collect a stable yield on their capital due to the lending of their tokens to options sellers and market makers.

<details>
<summary>5. DAOs and protocol treasuries</summary>
DAOs and protocol treasuries are typically in a uniquely difficult position when trying to deploy liquidity in a Uniswap pool: how to create liquid markets without having to deploy ETH or stablecoins?

By seeding a Panoptic pool from the "token" side, DAOs will effectively increase the liquidity available for the creating of call options, which in turn should allow both retail speculators and pro-tail users to profit from an increase in token price.

# How do Panoptic Options differ from traditional options?

Options in Panoptic, however, differ slightly from conventional options.
Instead of using a clearginhouse to settle options constracts, the Panoptic protocol uses Liquidity Provider (LP) positions in Uniswap v3 as a fundamental building block for trading long and short options.

Panoptic allows users to access to new and improved features when options trading:

- Panoptic Options [never expire and are perpetual](/docs/panoptic-protocol/overview#liquidity-providing-as-selling-options)
- Anybody can deploy an options market on any asset in a [permissionless manner](/docs/category/technical-specifications)
- Panoptic enables anyone to lend their capital to options traders as a [liquidity provider](docs/panoptic-protocol/protocol-roles#liquidity-providers)
- Options have [unique properties](/docs/panoptic-protocol/option-properties): width, new concept of moneyness, user-defined numeraire, etc.
- [Pricing](/docs/panoptic-protocol/premium) is path-dependent and does not involve counterparties (such as market makers)
- There is no concept of [vega], which means that the premium for open positions will not be affected by volatility expansion
- Collateralization requirements and buying power reduction [respond](/docs/panoptic-protocol/liquidations) to market activity
- Buying power requirements [do not change over time](/docs/panoptic-protocol/collateral)
- Commissions are paid [only once](/docs/panoptic-protocol/collateral#commissions--fees), when the position is created
- Distressed accounts will be [liquidated](/docs/panoptic-protocol/liquidations) by external users
- External users may [forcefully exercise](/docs/panoptic-protocol/liquidations#forced-exercise) far out-of-the-money long positions

<summary>What is the relationship between Panoptic and the Uniswap v3 protocol?</summary>

The core idea behind Perpetual Options is that Uniswap v3 liquidity provider (LP) positions can be seen as tokenized short puts.
This core results emerges from the simple observation that providing concentrated liquidity in Uniswap v3 generates a payoff that is mathematically identical to selling a put option.
This means that Uniswap v3 LP tokens can be users as a primitive for an option contract.
What Panoptic enables is the minting of options in a "peer-to-protocol" manner by facilitating the minting of LP tokens as long/short puts and calls.

At a core level, Panoptic has deployed a smart contract that replaces the `NonFungiblePositionManager.sol` smart contract from `v3-periphery`.
This smart contract, called the `SemiFungiblePositionMananger.sol`, uses the `ERC1155` interface to track positions within Uniswap v3
The SFPM and the NFPM both interact with the `UniswapV3Pool.sol` smart contracts to deploy and track liquidity positions.

The Panoptic interface allows existing Uniswap v3 liquidity providers to easily migrate their positions from NFPM to SFPM, replicating all the basic functionalities of NFPM but with a 30% decrease in gas costs. 
In addition to the `SemiFungiblePositionManager.sol` contract, users in Panoptic can also deploy `PanopticPool.sol`, which effectively unlocks an options market on top of any `UniswapV3Pool` pair.

# What are the risks?

Options trading is not for everyone.
Like any form of leveraged trading, trading options is associated with significant risks.
Any user that wishes to interact with the Panoptic protocol has to understand the risks involved.

The main risks are:
- **Over-exposure**: losing due to [leveraged exposure](/docs/panoptic-protocol/collateral).
- **Unfavorable pricing**: paying a [large premium](/docs/panoptic-protocol/premium) for options.
- **Forced exercise**: having [far-the-money](/docs/panoptic-protocol/risks) positions closed by external actors/liquidators.
- **Liquidations**: losing deposited collateral because of a [margin call](/docs/panoptic-protocol/liquidations).
