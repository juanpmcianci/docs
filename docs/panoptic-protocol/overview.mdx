# Panoptic Overview
A basic overview of the Panoptic Protocol.

### What are Options?

Options are one of the most traded instrument in traditional finance.
They can be used to [hedge](docs/trading/basic-concepts) a portfolio, [speculate](/docs/trading/perpetual-options) on the value of an asset, create [synthetic positions](docs/trading/multi-leg-strategies) in a capital-efficient manner, or as a way to create [defined-risk](docs/trading/risks) positions.

Options are an agreement between two parties to buy (or sell) an asset for a fixed price at a pre-determined time.
Hence, each option has a
- **Strike**: the agreed-upon price the asset has to be bought/sold
- **Expiry**: a time in the future when the transaction has to occur
- **Premium**: the value of the option, or how much does the buyer pays for the right to buy/sell the asset

(figure here)

The value of an option --called the premium-- used to be difficult to determine.
Following the development of Nobel-prize winning mathematical models by Black, Scholes, and Merton, an optimal price can be derived in a way that buyers _and_ sellers both agree on the option contract's price.


### How do Panoptic Options differ from traditional options?

Options in Panoptic, however, are a little bit different than traditional options..
Behind the scenes, the Panoptic protocol utilizes Liquidity Provider (LP) positions in Uniswap v3 as a core primitive for trading long and short options.
Concretely, this means that:

- Options are [perpetual and never expire](/docs/panoptic-protocol/overview#liquidity-providing-as-selling-options)
- Anybody can deploy an options market on any asset in a [permissionless manner](/docs/category/technical-specifications)
- Panoptic allows anyone to be a [liquidity provider](docs/panoptic-protocol/protocol-roles#liquidity-providers) to lend their capital to options traders 
- Options have [unique properties](/docs/panoptic-protocol/option-properties): width, new concept of moneyness, user-defined numeraire, etc.
- [Pricing](/docs/panoptic-protocol/premium) does not involved counterparties (like market makers) and is path-dependent
- There is no concept of [vega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_(finance)#Vega), which means premium for open positions will be affected by volatility expansion
- Collateralization requirements and buying power reduction [respond](/docs/panoptic-protocol/liquidations) to market activity
- Commissions are paid [only once](/docs/panoptic-protocol/collateral#commissions--fees), when the position is created
- Users can [delegate funds](/docs/) to another account
- Distressed accounts will be [liquidated](/docs/panoptic-protocol/liquidations) by external users
- Long positions that are far-the-money may be [forced exercised](/docs/panoptic-protocol/liquidations#forced-exercise) by external users
