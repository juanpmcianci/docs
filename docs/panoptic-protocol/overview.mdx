# Panoptic overview
This is an introductory summary of the Panoptic Protocol.

# Who should use Panoptic?

Options are one of the most traded instrument in traditional finance.
They can be used to [hedge](docs/trading/basic-concepts) a portfolio, [speculate](/docs/trading/perpetual-options) on the value of an asset, create [synthetic positions](docs/trading/multi-leg-strategies) in a capital-efficient manner, or as a way to create [defined-risk](docs/trading/risks) positions.

However, investors that first learn about options may be overwhelmed at first. 
While the math behind options may seem daunting for most users, anyone without a math background may still earn sustainable returns as long as users follow a cores set of [basic rules](/docs/trading/basic-concepts).

Here is how Panoptic can be useful for different user profiles:

<details>
<summary>1. Retail Users</summary>
Retail investors may trade options the same way they trade stock or tokens: they may buy call options to profit when the underlying increases in price, or they can buy put options to profit when the underlying goes down in price.
Retail user can also choose to participate indecentralize option vaults (a novel type of managed investment instrument pioneered by Ribbon) that can easily be implemented in Panoptic to target strategy that can be bearish, bullish, delta-neutral, or any combination thereof.

<details>
<summary>2. "Pro-tail" Users</summary>
Investors which are comfortable enough to manage a self-directed investment portfolio (we call those professional retail, or pro-tail, users)  may employ strategies which occupy the gap between the retail and professional levels.
In Panoptic, these users could be DeFi-native users that are comfortable with liquidity providing in AMMs and liquidity mining in protocol such as Uniswap or Sushiswap.
Or they could be seasoned TradFi options traders that may want to get exposure to 24/7 markets on the long-tail of digital assets that are tradable on Uniswap v3.

# How do Panoptic Options differ from traditional options?

Options in Panoptic, however, differ slightly from conventional options.

The Panoptic protocol uses Liquidity Provider (LP) positions in Uniswap v3 as a fundamental building block for trading long and short options.

<details>
<summary>What is the relationship between Panoptic and the Uniswap v3 protocol?</summary>

The idea behind Perpetual Options is the simple observation that providing concentrated liquidity in Uniswap v3 generates a payoff that is mathematically identical to selling a put option.
In a sense, the liquidity provider (LP) positions are tokenized short puts.
What Panoptic enables is the minting of options in a "peer-to-protocol" manner but facilitating the transfer of these tokenized LP positions to create long/short puts and calls.

</details>

Specifically, this means that with Panoptic you get access to new and improved features when options trading:

- Panoptic Options [never expire and are perpetual](/docs/panoptic-protocol/overview#liquidity-providing-as-selling-options)
- Anybody can deploy an options market on any asset in a [permissionless manner](/docs/category/technical-specifications)
- Panoptic enables anyone to lend their capital to options traders as a [liquidity provider](docs/panoptic-protocol/protocol-roles#liquidity-providers)
- Options have [unique properties](/docs/panoptic-protocol/option-properties): width, new concept of moneyness, user-defined numeraire, etc.
- [Pricing](/docs/panoptic-protocol/premium) is path-dependent and does not involve counterparties (such as market makers)
- There is no concept of [vega], which means that the premium for open positions will not be affected by volatility expansion
- Collateralization requirements and buying power reduction [respond](/docs/panoptic-protocol/liquidations) to market activity
- Commissions are paid [only once](/docs/panoptic-protocol/collateral#commissions--fees), when the position is created
- Users can [delegate funds](/docs/panoptic-protocol/delegation) to another account
- Distressed accounts will be [liquidated](/docs/panoptic-protocol/liquidations) by external users
- External users may [forcefully exercise](/docs/panoptic-protocol/liquidations#forced-exercise) far out-of-the-money long positions

# What are the risks?

Options trading is not for everyone.
Like any form of leveraged trading, trading options is associated with significant risks.
Any user that wishes to interact with the Panoptic protocol has to understand the risks involved.

The main risks are:
- **Over-exposure**: losing due to [leveraged exposure](./panoptic-protocol/collateral).
- **Unfavorable pricing**: paying a [large premium](./panoptic-protocol/premium) for options.
- **Forced exercise**: having [far-the-money](./panoptic-protocol/risks) positions closed by external actors/liquidators.
- **Liquidations**: losing deposited collateral because of a [margin call](./panoptic-protocol/liquidations).
