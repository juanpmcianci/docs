# Panoptic Overview
A basic overview of the Panoptic Protocol.

# Who is Panoptic for?

Investors that first learn about options may be overwhelmed at first. 
While the math behind options may seem daunting for most users, anyone without a math background may still earn sustainable returns as long as users follow a cores set of [basic rules](/docs/trading/basic-concepts).

# Retail Users
Retail investors may trade options the same way they trade stock or tokens: they may buy call options to profit when the underlying increases in price, or they can buy put options to profit when the underlying goes down in price.
In Decentralized Finance, the retail user can also

# What is the relationship between Panoptic and the Uniswap v3 protocol?

The idea behind Perpetual Options is the simple observation that providing concentrated liquidity in Uniswap v3 generates a payoff that is mathematically identical to selling a put option.
In a sense, the liquidity provider (LP) positions are tokenized short puts.
What Panoptic enables is the minting of options in a "peer-to-protocol" manner but facilitating the transfer of these tokenized LP positions to create long/short puts and calls.

# How do Panoptic Options differ from traditional options?

Options in Panoptic, however, are a little bit different than traditional options..
Behind the scenes, the Panoptic protocol utilizes Liquidity Provider (LP) positions in Uniswap v3 as a core primitive for trading long and short options.
Concretely, this means that:

- Options are [perpetual and never expire](/docs/panoptic-protocol/overview#liquidity-providing-as-selling-options)
- Anybody can deploy an options market on any asset in a [permissionless manner](/docs/category/technical-specifications)
- Panoptic allows anyone to be a [liquidity provider](docs/panoptic-protocol/protocol-roles#liquidity-providers) to lend their capital to options traders 
- Options have [unique properties](/docs/panoptic-protocol/option-properties): width, new concept of moneyness, user-defined numeraire, etc.
- [Pricing](/docs/panoptic-protocol/premium) does not involved counterparties (like market makers) and is path-dependent
- There is no concept of [vega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_(finance)#Vega), which means premium for open positions will be affected by volatility expansion
- Collateralization requirements and buying power reduction [respond](/docs/panoptic-protocol/liquidations) to market activity
- Commissions are paid [only once](/docs/panoptic-protocol/collateral#commissions--fees), when the position is created
- Users can [delegate funds](/docs/panoptic-protocol/delegation) to another account
- Distressed accounts will be [liquidated](/docs/panoptic-protocol/liquidations) by external users
- Long positions that are far-the-money may be [forced exercised](/docs/panoptic-protocol/liquidations#forced-exercise) by external users

# What are the risks?

Options trading is not for everyone.
Like any form of leveraged trading, trading options is associated with significant risks.
Any user that wishes to interact with the Panoptic protocol has to understand the risks involved.

The main risks are:
- **Over-exposure**: losing due to [leveraged exposure](./panoptic-protocol/collateral).
- **Unfavorable pricing**: paying a [large premium](./panoptic-protocol/premium) for options.
- **Forced exercise**: having [far-the-money](./panoptic-protocol/risks) positions closed by external actors/liquidators.
- **Liquidations**: losing deposited collateral because of a [margin call](./panoptic-protocol/liquidations).
