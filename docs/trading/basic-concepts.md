# Options basics
What are options and how to manage them.

## What are Options?

Options are an agreement between two parties to buy (or sell) an asset for a fixed price at a pre-determined time.
Hence, each option has a
- **Strike**: the agreed-upon price the asset has to be bought/sold
- **Expiry**: a time in the future when the transaction has to occur
- **Premium**: the value of the option, or how much does the buyer pays for the right to buy/sell the asset

Options provide options traders with a versatile tool for managing risk and generating profits.
By buying or selling options, traders can [speculate](/docs/trading/perpetual-options) in a capital efficient manner on the price movement of a security. This is done by taking a long or short position without having to own the underlying asset.
Options can also be used to manage portfolio risk, by [hedging](/docs/trading/basic-concepts) against potential losses in other investments.
In addition, options can be used to generate income, through the writing of options contracts.
Because options allow traders to take on different levels of risk, and also [defined-risk](/docs/trading/risks) positions, they are a useful tool for managing financial portfolios.

The value of an option&#151;called the premium&#151;used to be difficult to determine.
Following the development of Nobel-prize winning mathematical models by <Term popup="The Black-Scholes model, aka the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model, is a differential equation widely used to price options contracts." reference="/docs/terms/blackscholes">Black, Scholes, and Merton</Term>, an optimal price can be derived in a way that buyers _and_ sellers both agree on the option contract's price.
