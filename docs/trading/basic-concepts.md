# Options basics
What are options and how to manage them.

## What are Options?

Options are one of the most traded instrument in traditional finance.
They can be used to [hedge](docs/trading/basic-concepts) a portfolio, [speculate](/docs/trading/perpetual-options) on the value of an asset, create [synthetic positions](docs/trading/multi-leg-strategies) in a capital-efficient manner, or as a way to create [defined-risk](docs/trading/risks) positions.

Options are an agreement between two parties to buy (or sell) an asset for a fixed price at a pre-determined time.
Hence, each option has a
- **Strike**: the agreed-upon price the asset has to be bought/sold
- **Expiry**: a time in the future when the transaction has to occur
- **Premium**: the value of the option, or how much does the buyer pays for the right to buy/sell the asset

(figure here)

The value of an option --called the premium-- used to be difficult to determine.
Following the development of Nobel-prize winning mathematical models by Black, Scholes, and Merton, an optimal price can be derived in a way that buyers _and_ sellers both agree on the option contract's price.
