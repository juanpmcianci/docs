# The Road to Beta Launch

As we move closer to our gated, [beta launch](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/gated-launch-sign-up), we invite you to see how we got here and where we hope to go. Right now, we have more than 4,000 users [signed up](http://signup.panoptic.xyz) to participate in our upcoming launch, and this energetic response from our community is a testament to the widespread interest in our DeFi options platform.

  

We're working tirelessly to ensure a secure and optimized experience for all, and we could not be more excited to share what we’ve been working on with all of you.

## About the Beta Launch

  

Our beta launch is comprised of multiple epochs of consecutive individual trading competitions. Each epoch increases the complexity and degrees of freedom in Panoptic which will stress test the platform in a gradual manner.

  

Participants will deposit their own real funds to engage in buying and selling DeFi-native options. The competitive element adds to the excitement and creates more realistic data making it a win-win for all.

  

The lowest-ranking performers face potential exclusion from future competitions, while the top performers stand to win from a pool of $100,000 in prizes!

  

During the beta launch, we will seek [feedback](https://feedback.panoptic.xyz) from participants and our broader community. Anyone can voice their opinion or concern and will be rewarded for impactful and constructive responses.

## The Road To Get Here

  

Here's a quick look at the significant milestones we've reached on our path to this exciting launch:

## The Road Ahead

We're incredibly proud of our achievements to date, but our journey is just beginning. Here are the remaining milestones we're working towards to deliver the beta version of Panoptic's DeFi options trading platform:

  

1.  Completion of OpenZeppelin audit
    

  

We began an audit with top security firm [OpenZeppelin](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/openzeppelin-audits-panoptic-defi-options-protocol) in March 2023, and we are currently working to finalize the audit. When this is complete, we will be able to release the audit reports to the public.

  

2.  Completion of Panoptic subgraph and frontend
    

  

We will finalize the Panoptic subgraph and connection to the frontend of Panoptic. This means our platform will have full web3 integration including the smart contracts, subgraph, and the app. Also included is Panoptic’s [novel UI](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/demoing-panoptic-defi-options-protocol) with its seamless, draggable payoff curves.

  

3.  Formalization of bug bounty program
    

  

We plan to have a formal process for anybody to submit smart contract or UI bugs in a secure manner. Bug reports will be monetarily rewarded depending on the severity of the vulnerability and details provided.

  

4.  Open our smart contract code for review
    

  

After the smart contract code audit with OpenZeppelin is completed and the bug bounty program released, we will make Panoptic's smart contract code fully open to the public and available for full review.

  

5.  Finalize Epoch 1 pool parameter values
    

We will provide the finalized values of each [pool parameter](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/gated-launch-parameters) for Epoch 1 including information about the collateral requirements, fees, and pool utilization targets.

  

6.  Kick off Epoch 1
    

Once all of the above is released, we will launch the very first epoch and trading competition of the Panoptic protocol. We will provide videos showing step-by-step tutorials on basic actions users can take such as depositing liquidity, selling an option, and buying an option.
