### [American Options](/docs/terms/American) 
An option that can be exercised any time up to and including the expiration date. They are slightly more complicated to price than European-style options


### [Asks](/docs/terms/Ask) 
The Ask is the price at which an option or stock is offered for sale. It represents the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept for the security.


### [At the Money (ATM)](/docs/terms/atm) 
At-the-Money (ATM) refers to a situation when the strike price of an option is equal to the current market price of the underlying asset. In this scenario, the option has no intrinsic value, only time value.

### [Bid](/docs/terms/bid) 
The Bid is the price at which an option or stock is available for purchase. It represents the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for the security.


### [Black-Scholes](/docs/terms/blackscholes) 
The Black-Scholes model, aka the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model, is a differential equation widely used to price options contracts.


### [Break-Even Point](/docs/terms/break_even_point) 
The Break-Even Point is the price at which an option position neither gains nor loses value. It is the point at which the total cost of entering the position is offset by the gains from the position. Calculating the break-even point helps traders assess their potential risk and rewards before entering a trade.

### [Butterfly Spread](/docs/terms/butterfly) 
A Butterfly Spread is an options strategy that involves buying and selling options with different strike prices and expiration dates, resulting in limited risk and potential profit. It is typically established by purchasing one in-the-money option, selling two at-the-money options, and buying one out-of-the-money option, all with the same expiration date.


### [Calendar Spread](/docs/terms/calendar) 
A Calendar Spread is an options strategy that involves the simultaneous purchase and sale of options with the same strike price but different expiration dates. This strategy seeks to profit from the time decay of options premiums, as the near-term option loses value faster than the longer-term option.

### [Call Option](/docs/terms/call) 
A Call Option is a contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy an underlying asset at a specified price (strike price) within a specific period (expiration date). If the underlying asset's price rises above the strike price before expiration, the option holder can exercise the option and buy the asset at the lower strike price.


### [Collar](/docs/terms/collar) 
A Collar is an options strategy that involves holding a long position in the underlying asset, while simultaneously buying a put option and selling a call option to limit risk and potential profit. The sold call option generates income that helps offset the cost of buying the put option, providing downside protection for the long position in the underlying asset.


### [Covered Call](/docs/terms/covered) 
A Covered Call is an options strategy that involves holding a long position in the underlying asset and selling a call option on the same asset to generate additional income. This strategy can be used when an investor expects the price of the underlying asset to remain relatively stable or rise moderately, allowing them to earn income from the option premium.


### [Delta](/docs/terms/delta) 
Delta is a measure of the sensitivity of an option's price to changes in the price of the underlying asset. It represents the expected change in the option's price for a $1 change in the price of the underlying asset. A call option with a delta of 0.5, for example, would be expected to increase by $0.50 if the underlying asset's price increased by $1.

### [European Option](/docs/terms/european) 
A European-Style Option is an option that can only be exercised on its expiration date. Unlike American-style options, which can be exercised at any time before expiration, European-style options have a single exercise date, limiting the flexibility of the option holder in terms of exercising their rights.


### [Extrinsic Value](/docs/terms/extrinsinc) 
Extrinsic Value is the portion of an option's price that is not related to the intrinsic value and is attributed to factors such as time until expiration and implied volatility. It represents the additional premium that the market is willing to pay for the option based on the possibility that the option could become profitable before expiration.



### [Gamma](/docs/terms/gamma) 
Gamma is a measure of the rate of change of an option's delta with respect to changes in the price of the underlying asset. It indicates how much the delta of an option is expected to change when the underlying asset's price changes by $1. High gamma values indicate that the option's delta is more sensitive to price changes in the underlying asset.

### [Greeks](/docs/terms/greeks) 
Greeks are a set of measures used to assess the risk and sensitivity of options pricing to various factors, including changes in the underlying asset's price, time to expiration, and volatility. The primary Greeks are Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho. Each Greek represents a different aspect of an option's price behavior, helping traders manage their options positions and make more informed decisions.


### [Intrinsic Value](/docs/terms/intrinsic) 
Intrinsic Value is the value of an option if it were exercised immediately, calculated as the difference between the strike price and the current market price of the underlying asset. It represents the profit that could be realized if the option were exercised and the underlying asset were immediately bought or sold at the market price.


### [Iron Condor](/docs/terms/ironCOndor) 
An Iron Condor is an options strategy that involves selling an out-of-the-money call and put, and buying a further out-of-the-money call and put, resulting in a limited risk and limited profit potential position. The strategy seeks to profit from a range-bound market, where the underlying asset's price remains between the two sold option strike prices.



### [In the Money (ITM)](/docs/terms/itm) 
In-the-Money (ITM) refers to a situation when the strike price of a call option is below the current market price of the underlying asset, or when the strike price of a put option is above the current market price of the underlying asset. In these scenarios, the option has intrinsic value, as exercising the option would result in a profit.

### [Implied Volatility (IV)](/docs/terms/iv) 
Implied Volatility is a measure of the expected volatility of the underlying asset, derived from the market price of an option. It reflects the market's expectation of how much the price of the underlying asset will fluctuate over the life of the option. Higher implied volatility indicates a higher degree of uncertainty about the future price of the asset.


### [Long Position](/docs/terms/iv) 
Implied Volatility is a measure of the expected volatility of the underlying asset, derived from the market price of an option. It reflects the market's expectation of how much the price of the underlying asset will fluctuate over the life of the option. Higher implied volatility indicates a higher degree of uncertainty about the future price of the asset.


### [Long Position](/docs/terms/margin) 
The amount of money or collateral that an investor must deposit with a broker to cover potential losses on an options position.


### [Naked Option](/docs/terms/mnaked) 
The sale of an option without owning the underlying asset or an offsetting option position.

### [Notional Value](/docs/terms/notional)
The sale of an option without owning the underlying asset or an offsetting option position. 

### [optionChain](/docs/terms/optionChain)
A list of options available for a specific underlying asset, including information on strike prices, expiration dates, and option prices.


### [Out of the Money](/docs/terms/otm)
When the strike price of a call option is above the current market price of the underlying asset, or when the strike price of a put option is below the current market price of the underlying asset.

### [Panoptions](/docs/terms/panoptic)
Panoptions are  perpetual, oracle-less, decentralized, option based on Uniswap V3. They take advange of the fact that ptoviding liquidity in Uniswap V3 is akin to selling covered calls. Panoptic makes use of this obvservation to provide an environment for the decentralized exchange of these instruments by allowing users to "reshufle" liquidity in UniV3 pools in such a way that it behaves as buying/selling options. 

### [Perpetual Options](/docs/terms/perps)
Perpetual Options are options contracts that have no expiration date, allowing the holder to retain the right to exercise the option indefinitely. In TradFi, these options are rare and typically trade over-the-counter (OTC) rather than on standardized exchanges, but are becoming increasingly popular in DeFi. Due to their lack of an expiration date, perpetual options tend to have higher premiums compared to options with similar strike prices and underlying assets but with set expiration dates.


### [Option Premium](/docs/terms/premium)
The price paid by the buyer of an option to the seller. Can be given by the Black-Scholes model for vanilla European options, or via the streaming premium for Panoptions. 


### [Put Option](/docs/terms/put)
A contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell an underlying asset at a specified price (strike price)


### [Range of a Position](/docs/terms/range)
Uniswap V3 allows users to provide concentrated liquidity. By range, we mean the prices at which a given user is providing liquidity.


### [Short Position](/docs/terms/short)
A Short Position is a trading strategy in which an investor bets on a decline in the price of an asset, such as a stock, option, or futures contract. To establish a short position, the investor typically borrows the asset from a broker and sells it, with the expectation of buying it back later at a lower price to return it to the lender. A short position can be profitable if the asset's price declines, but it carries the risk of unlimited losses if the asset's price rises instead.


### [Streaming premium](/docs/terms/streaming)
Panoptic uses a novel pricing mechanism called "straming premia". In this setting, buyers do not pay an option premium up fron, but rather a position collects fees as it stays in range. The amount of fees collected are those that would have been collected by providing liquidity in UniV3 plus some spread. 



### [Theta](/docs/terms/theta)
Theta is a measure of an option's price sensitivity to time decay, representing the expected change in the option's price for a one-day decrease in the time to expiration. A negative theta value indicates that the option's price will decrease as time passes, all else being equal. This is particularly important for options sellers, as they can benefit from the time decay of options premiums if the underlying asset's price remains stable or moves in their favor.



### [Volatility Smile](/docs/terms/volSmile)
A Volatility Smile is a pattern observed in the implied volatility of options across different strike prices, where the implied volatility tends to be higher for options that are in-the-money or out-of-the-money compared to at-the-money options. This pattern resembles a smile on a graph plotting implied volatility against strike prices. The volatility smile reflects the market's perception of a higher probability of large price movements for the underlying asset, especially for options with strike prices far from the current market price.
