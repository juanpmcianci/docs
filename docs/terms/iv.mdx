### Term explanation 

Implied Volatility is a measure of the expected volatility of the underlying asset, derived from the market price of an option. It reflects the market's expectation of how much the price of the underlying asset will fluctuate over the life of the option. Higher implied volatility indicates a higher degree of uncertainty about the future price of the asset.
