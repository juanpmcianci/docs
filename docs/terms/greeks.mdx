### Term explanation

Greeks are a set of measures used to assess the risk and sensitivity of options pricing to various factors, including changes in the underlying asset's price, time to expiration, and volatility. The primary Greeks are Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho. Each Greek represents a different aspect of an option's price behavior, helping traders manage their options positions and make more informed decisions.
