### Term explanation 

Gamma is a measure of the rate of change of an option's delta with respect to changes in the price of the underlying asset. It indicates how much the delta of an option is expected to change when the underlying asset's price changes by $1. High gamma values indicate that the option's delta is more sensitive to price changes in the underlying asset.
