### Term explanation

The Notional Value of an Option is the theoretical value of the underlying asset represented by an option contract. It is calculated by multiplying the option's contract size (typically 100 shares per contract) by the strike price. The notional value represents the amount of the underlying asset that the option contract controls, providing a basis for comparing the option's price to the value of the underlying asset.
