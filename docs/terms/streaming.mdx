### Term explanation

Panoptic uses a novel pricing mechanism called "streamia" (streaming premia). In this setting, buyers do not pay an option premium up front, but rather a position collects fees as it stays in range. The amount of fees collected are those that would have been collected by providing liquidity in Uniswap v3 plus an additional liquidity-based spread.
