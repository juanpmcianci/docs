### Term explanation

Panoptic uses a novel pricing mechanism called "straming premia". In this setting, buyers do not pay an option premium up fron, but rather a position collects fees as it stays in range. The amount of fees collected are those that would have been collected by providing liquidity in UniV3 plus some spread.
