### Term explanation

A Covered Call is an options strategy that involves holding a long position in the underlying asset and selling a call option on the same asset to generate additional income. This strategy can be used when an investor expects the price of the underlying asset to remain relatively stable or rise moderately, allowing them to earn income from the option premium.
