### Term explanation

A Collar is an options strategy that involves holding a long position in the underlying asset, while simultaneously buying a put option and selling a call option to limit risk and potential profit. The sold call option generates income that helps offset the cost of buying the put option, providing downside protection for the long position in the underlying asset.
