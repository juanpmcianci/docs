### Term explanation 

An Iron Condor is an options strategy that involves selling an out-of-the-money call and put, and buying a further out-of-the-money call and put, resulting in a limited risk and limited profit potential position. The strategy seeks to profit from a range-bound market, where the underlying asset's price remains between the two sold option strike prices.
