### Term explanation

A Call Option is a contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy an underlying asset at a specified price (strike price) within a specific period (expiration date). If the underlying asset's price rises above the strike price before expiration, the option holder can exercise the option and buy the asset at the lower strike price.
