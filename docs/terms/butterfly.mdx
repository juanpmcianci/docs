### Term explanation

A Butterfly Spread is an options strategy that involves buying and selling options with different strike prices and expiration dates, resulting in limited risk and potential profit. It is typically established by purchasing one in-the-money option, selling two at-the-money options, and buying one out-of-the-money option, all with the same expiration date.
