### Term explanation 

In-the-Money (ITM) refers to a situation when the strike price of a call option is below the current market price of the underlying asset, or when the strike price of a put option is above the current market price of the underlying asset. In these scenarios, the option has intrinsic value, as exercising the option would result in a profit.
