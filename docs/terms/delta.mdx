### Term explanation 

Delta is a measure of the sensitivity of an option's price to changes in the price of the underlying asset. It represents the expected change in the option's price for a $1 change in the price of the underlying asset. A call option with a delta of 0.5, for example, would be expected to increase by $0.50 if the underlying asset's price increased by $1.
