### Extrinsic Value

Extrinsic Value is the portion of an option's price that is not related to the intrinsic value and is attributed to factors such as time until expiration and implied volatility. It represents the additional premium that the market is willing to pay for the option based on the possibility that the option could become profitable before expiration.
