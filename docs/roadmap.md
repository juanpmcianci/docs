# Panoptic’s V1 Roadmap
As we near the end of the roadmap for releasing Panoptic V1 to mainnet in the fall of this year, we wanted to highlight a few key moments.

As a reminder, this roadmap is a live document. We will make adjustments as we attain each milestone.

## Inception
We formed the company in July of 2022 as we seriously began building the product. We developed a rough early prototype with help from a Web3 incubator, and then it was time to build the actual platform — from scratch.

We are two [technical founders](https://panoptic.xyz/docs/faq/ask-the-founder). We didn’t have much experience building smart contracts then, but that was about to change.

## Smart Contract Development & First Audit
We both jumped in to build and prepare the smart contracts for our first audit, which began with [ABDK](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/abdk-audit-completion) in December 2022. We worked around the clock and completed the contracts in time for the audit!

## Frontend Development
We started the frontend engineering work in January and just showed the product's first live demo to the world at [ETH Denver 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt5AdCNavjs&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fpanoptic.xyz%2F)! We are moving fast and executing, which is key.

We wanted to highlight also that in February, we started work on our novel advanced graphing library running bare-metal on top of Javascript, which will give a unique, extremely fast, and simplified UX to Panoptic’s users. You can [seamlessly drag the payoff curve](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/demoing-panoptic-defi-options-protocol) to create whatever custom curve you see fit.

## Second Audit & Gated Launch
We are finishing our audit with [OpenZeppelin](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/openzeppelin-audits-panoptic-defi-options-protocol) and then we will launch the [beta version](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/gated-launch-sign-up) of the Panoptic protocol. [Here](https://panoptic.xyz/docs/gated-launch/launch-roadmap)'s a "mini" roadmap of the remaining milestones till we launch our DeFi options trading platform.

We have a lot planned out for the next iteration of our protocol, V2, but we are focused 100% on bringing V1 to mainnet and achieving product-market fit, growth, and expansion.
