The Panoptic team had a fantastic experience at the [2023 Cornell Blockchain Conference](https://www.cornellblockchainconference.com/) immersing ourselves in the vibrant atmosphere and actively engaging with our community. It was a valuable opportunity to establish meaningful connections with fellow DeFi organizations, fostering collaboration and shared insights.

This year's event witnessed unprecedented participation, with the venue selling out all 600 tickets. Despite the bear market, the conference had more attendees than last year‚Äôs event during the bull market, underscoring the remarkable growth and evolution of the industry.

## **April 20**

We kicked off the conference weekend on Thursday by hosting ‚ÄúAn Evening With Endless Options,‚Äù an event open to the public in Midtown Manhattan. The venue included a room to present our [product demo](https://youtu.be/deqbeqjyKgg) and an outdoor patio to take in the view of the city skyline. In light of the interest, we augmented the available slots the week leading to the event.

Attendees enjoyed free hors d‚Äôoeuvres and cocktails served from an on-site bartender. The ambiance was elevated by the sounds of Erhling spun by the DJ.

During the conference, we had the privilege of engaging with numerous builders, peers, and investors who share our passion for the industry. These interactions led to fruitful conversations and enabled us to establish meaningful connections with key players in the space.

We are now back to building and will keep you all posted as we prepare for our gated launch in early July ‚Äî just one year after starting Panoptic!

To the organizers and to Cornell Blockchain:

> ‚Äú*Thank you for making us feel at home and a part of the tight-knit Cornell community that is constantly innovating in the realm of Web3.*‚Äù ‚Äî Jesper
