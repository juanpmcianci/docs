With Panoptic’s beta launch in full swing, we invite every current and future option trader to experience how perpetual options will revolutionize the future of finance on our [demo platform](https://demo.panoptic.xyz/).

  

Our demo is a risk-free learning and trading environment that provides an ideal space to develop and expand your perpetual options trading skills. As people explore our demo, they can earn points through our [community program](https://galxe.com/panoptic) to gain access to exclusive prizes.

  

## About Our Demo

  

Panoptic’s demo is hosted on the Ethereum test network [Sepolia](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/sepolia-testnet), and replicates the conditions of trading actual perpetual options. In short, Panoptic's demo is a paper trading version of our platform that ensures a secure and efficient trial environment for users to experiment and learn.

  

By utilizing testnet tokens to mint positions, users can engage in risk-free practice, refining strategies and exploring the functionalities of Panoptic's platform.

  

## How To Use The Panoptic Demo

  

To start practicing buying and selling Panoptions, visit our [demo website](https://demo.panoptic.xyz/). Upon arrival, a pop-up window will guide you through obtaining testnet tokens and depositing liquidity. Connect your wallet to the platform to paper trade options.
