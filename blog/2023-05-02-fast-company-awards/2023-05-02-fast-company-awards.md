*The seventh annual awards honor creative solutions to some of the biggest issues facing us today.*

*Fast Company* revealed the winners of their highly-anticipated 2023 [World Changing Ideas Awards](https://www.fastcompany.com/world-changing-ideas/list?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_content=world-changing-ideas-2023) today. Among the remarkable entries was [Panoptic](https://www.panoptic.xyz/), our groundbreaking, permissionless options protocol which earned an honorable mention in the crypto and blockchain category.

Panoptic is the first permissionless protocol to overcome the technically challenging task of implementing DeFi-native options on the Ethereum blockchain. To create this paradigm-shifting protocol, Panoptic embraces the decentralized nature of Automated Market Makers (AMM) while leveraging the existing $4B liquidity in [Uniswap v3](https://uniswap.org/).

In Traditional Finance (TradFi), the options market commands more capital than equities. Yet, crypto options trading pales in comparison to spot trading. Panoptic’s work to help change this shortcoming is, in part, why we received an honorable mention in _Fast Company’s_ 2023 World Changing Ideas Awards.

> “We are honored and grateful to receive this recognition from Fast Company for our work,” says Guillaume Lambert, CEO of Panoptic. “This award not only recognizes our team’s unwavering dedication to democratizing access to options, but also inspires us to continue pushing towards our goal of educating our users on how to become better traders.”

A panel of [Fast Company](https://twitter.com/FastCompany) editors and reporters selected winners and finalists from a pool of more than 2,200 entries across urban design, education, nature, politics, technology, corporate social responsibility, and more. The 2023 awards feature entries from across the globe. Several new categories were added this year including rapid response, agriculture, and crypto and blockchain.

> “We’re thrilled to have our groundbreaking efforts acknowledged by _Fast Company_,” says Jesper Kristensen, COO of Panoptic. “As we continue to push the frontiers within our industry, we remain dedicated to empowering others within the DeFi and OpFi ecosystems to harness the potential of options and blockchain technology as a whole.”

*Fast Company*’s Spring 2023 issue will showcase some of the world’s most inventive entrepreneurs and forward-thinking companies that are actively tackling global challenges.

> “It’s thrilling to see the creativity and innovation that are so abundant among this year’s honorees,” says *Fast Company* editor-in-chief, Brendan Vaughan. “While it’s easy to feel discouraged by the state of the world, the entrepreneurs, companies, and nonprofits featured in this package show the limitless potential to address society’s most urgent problems. Our journalists have highlighted some of the most exciting and impactful work being done today — from housing to equity to sustainability — and we look forward to seeing not only how these projects evolve but how they inspire others to develop solutions of their own.”
