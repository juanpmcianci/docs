After one week of trading perpetual options, Epoch 1 of Panoptic's beta launch concluded. We are extremely appreciative of everyone who took part in the event, and we look forward to expanding the number of participants in Epoch 2.

  

We saw tremendous traction for our beta launch during the inaugural round of our trading competition, thanks in large part to our [community program](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/panoptic-community-program). In less than a week, we had more than 6,000 people participate in the community event in support of Epoch 1.

  

This conclusion comes as [previously scheduled](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/panoptic-beta-launch-epoch-one). We've received invaluable feedback and are excited to improve our app to further enhance the user experience of trading DeFi options.
