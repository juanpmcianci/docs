Today marks an exciting milestone as we proudly unveil Panoptic Research. With a focus on data analysis and experimentation, Panoptic Research aims to generate fresh insights and knowledge to enhance our business operations and engage the wider DeFi options community.

Launching this new research program is crucial for several reasons. First, it fosters innovation and competitiveness by facilitating the exploration of new ideas and technologies, especially in our rapidly evolving sector. Second, it enables us to engage in a two-way conversation with our users and stakeholders, ensuring that we consistently listen and innovate for their benefit.

Our objective is to deliver weekly educational content on DeFi options and blockchain technology.

Panoptic was [founded on research](https://lambert-guillaume.medium.com/) and continues to play a pivotal role within our organization and community. As [previously mentioned](https://www.panoptic.xyz/blog-posts/panoptic-x-simtopia), we are eager to establish collaborations with academic and business partners.

> "Our research program will also contribute to developing our organization's skills and capacities, providing opportunities for learning and expansion. Additionally, we intend to demonstrate our dedication to continual development and thought leadership. We believe that with careful design and execution, this new research program will have a substantial and long-lasting impact on our core business and the community at large," said Jesper Kristensen, Panoptic’s COO.

As part of the initiative, we have already launched our “Research Bites,” as recently stated by our CEO Guillaume Lambert [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/guil_lambert/status/1611151537039884290?s=20&t=5pmPVtgzPFB0TsBUUEIimw). These bites will be tweeted regularly and the underlying code will be hosted on our [public GitHub Research repository.](https://github.com/panoptic-labs/research)

We encourage you to follow and star this repository for regular updates.

At Panoptic, we prioritize transparency and reproducibility, which is why we make all our code publicly available for anyone to access and use. Additionally, we will provide [tutorials](https://github.com/panoptic-labs/research/tree/main/_research-bites/_tutorials) to help the widest audience understand and build upon our findings.

We look forward to collaborating with the community to realize the full potential of Web3.
