## A Transparent Leap Forward

  

At Panoptic, we [firmly believe](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/democratizing-defi-options-research-part-1) that transparency is paramount for a decentralized ecosystem to flourish. Making our smart contract code available to the public is an invitation for the community to come together, scrutinize, and collaborate.

  

This publication aligns with our core values of decentralization, trust, and assurance that we create a robust system that can withstand rigorous testing.

  

> *"I am incredibly proud of the effort our team has poured into Panoptic over the past year," said Guillaume Lambert, CEO and inventor of the Panoptic protocol.*
>
> *"I am extremely happy to finally share our work with the DeFi community and unveil how Panoptic works under the hood."*
