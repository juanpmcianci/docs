If you’re looking to dive deeper into the technical side of things, our research section is the place to explore. Here you’ll find educational resources on options strategies and free research on “all things DeFi options” for the community to participate in developing our platform.

Over the next few months, leading up to our 2023 Q3 Test Phase launch, we will concentrate our research efforts on Panoptic’s innovative perpetual options product, detailing its pricing mechanism, capital efficiency, associated risks, and trading strategies.

We’re committed to being transparent and collaborative, and our open-source code and Jupyter Notebooks on GitHub are just one way we’re working to achieve that.
