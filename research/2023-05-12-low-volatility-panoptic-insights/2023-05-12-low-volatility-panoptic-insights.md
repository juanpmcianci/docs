### Introduction
Deribit Insights found that the market is pricing in low vol based on declining implied vol on crypto options. They also analyze the ETH/BTC vol spread and [volatility skews](https://panoptic.xyz/research/uniswap-v3-implied-volatility-smile). Straddles are great ways to bet on volatility, so we analyze their performance below.

We'll cover:
- How you can sell straddles NOW on Uniswap
- Backtest BTC straddles
- Backtest ETH straddles
- Backtest BTC-ETH straddles

For a refresher on straddles and volatility bets see [here](https://panoptic.xyz/research/defi-option-strangle-straddle).

### Straddles
You can sell (perpetual) straddles via Uniswap v3 & Aave right now. For example, if ETH price = $1,000:
- LP centered around $1,000. Use 1 ETH + 1,000 USDC.
- Short 1 ETH (e.g. borrow on Aave & immediately sell)
- Your payoff curve will look like the pink curve

Tips:
- Your "perpetual premia" is the fees you collect from LPing
- The more fees you collect, the wider your straddle breakeven points become
- Use a narrow range (e.g. r = 1.1) for short-term positions
- Use a wide range (e.g. r = 1.6) for longer-term positions
For more info on how LP range and time horizons correlate, see [here](https://panoptic.xyz/research/zero-dte-defi-options).

### BTC straddle backtest (3/19 - 5/10)
Annualized return: +10.32%

When realized volatility (RV) is lower than expected, option sellers profit. The [drop in RV](http://messari.io/asset/bitcoin/chart/daily-vol) for BTC in April resulted in positive profits for short straddles.

### ETH straddle backtest
Annualized return: +13.8%

RV for [ETH also saw a drop](http://messari.io/asset/ethereum/chart/daily-vol) in April, resulting in short straddles on ETH being profitable.

### BTC-ETH straddle backtest
Annualized return: +2.1% (in ETH)

Panoptic revolutionizes options trading by introducing user-defined numeraires. For the first time, you can trade options directly on BTC-ETH prices (as opposed to BTC-USD + ETH-USD).

- Ignores gas/swap fees ‚õΩ
- Disclaimer: None of this is financial advice üì¢
- Past performance is no guarantee of future results ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Short straddles have unlimited loss potential! üìâ
