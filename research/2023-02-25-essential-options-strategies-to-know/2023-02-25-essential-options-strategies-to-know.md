### How Panoptic's Perpetual Options Have Effective DTEs
Panoptic mimics payoffs from long-term expiries through wide-ranged LP positions.

For example:

-   Narrow range (r = 1.087) ↔️ 1 day expiry
    
-   Wide range (r = 1.6) ↔️ 1 month expiry
    

(Assuming 100% annual volatility)

### Summary
Caveats:

-   Panoptions are perpetual options with streaming premia rather than upfront premia, so payoff curves may differ from above
    
-   Panoption premia depends on a number of factors including the underlying price path and LP width
