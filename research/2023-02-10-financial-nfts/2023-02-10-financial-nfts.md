The weekly volume on all NFT trading platforms was $120M last week. This includes BAYC, CryptoPunks, LOOT, Azuki, etc. But...$23 billion (yes, with a B) of value was traded on Uni V3 as financial NFTs üìà

Here's 8 reasons why Panoptic is bullish on financial NFTs:

### Uni V3 as a Financial NFT Platform
![img-2](./img-2.jpg)

First of all: why is Uni V3 a financial NFT platform? Liquidity in Uni V3 is deployed under a price range, which means LP positions are non-fungible and can't be tracked using ERC20s. Instead, Uniswap issues an ERC721 to track the funds controlled by each LP position.

#### Reason 1: Most derivatives in TradFi *are* NFTs.
![img-3](./img-3.jpg)

Futures contracts expire at a set date, and each underlying has multiple tickers. The Canadian dollar futures \6CH3 (exp. MAR-23) is different than the \6CM3 (JUN-23).

Options follow the OSI standard for exp, strikes, etc.

#### Reason 2: Tracking value using NFTs rather than ERC20 tokens does not require deploying new contracts.
![img-4](./img-4.png)

Each ERC20 is its own smart contract. So an application that requires the tracking of multiple expiries/strikes/sizes will need to deploy many new contracts‚õΩÔ∏è

#### Reason 3: the ERC1155 standard extends the capabilities of NFTs to enable "semi-fungibility".
![img-5](./img-5.png)

The balance of any ERC1155 token can be anything from 0 to 2^256 (compared to 1 for ERC721). Each NFT is unique but can have a balance that tracks size or liquidity, for instance.


#### Reason 4: The token ID of an ERC1155 is a uint256 that can encode information.
![img-6](./img-6.png)

In Panoptic, we encode info about the options positions inside its token ID. Each token encodes up to 4 legs which facilitates collateral computation for defined/undefined risk positions.

#### Reason 5: Non-fungible positions give more freedom to users.

Would everyone only want to trade the same 10‚àÜ puts? Of course not!

Options traders trade at a strike + expiry that match their risk tolerance. User-defined ERC1155s don't lock anyone into a specific strategy.

#### Reason 6: Financial NFTs can be traded on platforms like OpenSea.

Just like any NFT, Uni V3 LP positions can be traded between users ‚Äî often at a large loss! üëá

#### Reason 7: URI metadata can be used to add context to a transaction.

While the URI metadata of a PFP NFT will point to a specific JPEG, financial NFTs can use that slot to store information about the transaction itself ‚Äî PnL graph, entry/exit prices, pool liquidity, etc.

#### Reason 8: Options protocols like Panoptic have to use financial NFTs.

Uni V3 was a true pioneer in the world of financial NFTs. >$1T in total volume to date!

Panoptic will follow suit by making trading and minting of LP positions easier using the ERC1155 standard.
